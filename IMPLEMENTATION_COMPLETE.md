## 3. "Where should we be working on her online presence?"

### **DON'T WASTE TIME ON (Yet):**

- ❌ Instagram (unless Dee loves posting photos)
- ❌ TikTok (too time-intensive)
- ❌ Yelp (less important in Florida)
- ❌ Paid ads (do free stuff first)

---

## 4. "Did you check what she already has there?"

**UNABLE TO CHECK because:**

- Google search link was JavaScript redirect (blocked)
- Need you to open link and share:
  - Business name as listed
  - Phone number
  - Current star rating
  - Number of reviews
  - Screenshots of photos

**Once you provide, I'll:**

- Import existing reviews to website
- Match branding/messaging
- Use existing photos
- Maintain consistency

---

## 5. "How could I charge Dee based on results?"

### **RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Performance Model**

```
BASE FEE: $149/month
(Covers: hosting, maintenance, admin panel, updates)

+ PAY-PER-LEAD: $20 per qualified lead
(Form submission or tracked phone call)

MONTHLY CAP: $500 maximum total
```

**Example Months:**

**Slow Month:**

- Base: $149
- 5 leads × $20 = $100
- **Total: $249**

**Good Month:**

- Base: $149
- 15 leads × $20 = $300
- **Total: $449**

**Great Month:**

- Base: $149
- 20 leads × $20 = $400 → capped at $351
- **Total: $500 (cap)**

**Why This Works:**

- ✅ Dee has predictable costs
- ✅ You get paid for results
- ✅ Cap protects Dee from huge bills
- ✅ Base covers your maintenance time
- ✅ Incentivizes you to optimize site
